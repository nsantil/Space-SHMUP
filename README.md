Meaningful change:
    I added a pause button on the "p" key to allow for the user to step away from their game at any point and resume where they left off without losing any progress.


While I understand this is no excuse for turning in assignments late I had an issue where my group member did not give me access to write to the repository and when I went to merge my code with his it corrupted the work I had done. Because of this this assignment was turned in a few hours past the due date since I had to fix the issues that had arisen from that.
